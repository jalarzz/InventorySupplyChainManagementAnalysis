Inventory and Supply Chain Management Analysis
Project Overview

This project explores how data analytics can be applied to supply chain and inventory management. Using Power BI, the dashboard highlights key metrics such as warehouse utilization, transportation costs, lead times, backorders, and sales trends. The goal is to provide a clear overview of operational efficiency and to identify areas for potential improvement in logistics and inventory processes.

Insights

Accessories show the longest lead times, which may indicate supply delays.

Transportation costs are highest in the West region, especially for furniture.

Sales volumes have grown significantly since 2021.

Warehouse utilization is below the 75% benchmark, suggesting underused capacity.

Most backorders are fulfilled, but a notable share remain pending.
